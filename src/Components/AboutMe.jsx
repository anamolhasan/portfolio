            My journey into frontend development began with a curiosity about how websites work and the desire to build interactive, visually appealing digital experiences. Since then, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with modern frameworks like React. I enjoy learning about the latest trends in web design, from responsive layouts to cutting-edge JavaScript libraries, and I’m eager to apply this knowledge to real-world projects.

Whether it’s perfecting a pixel-perfect design or solving complex interaction challenges, I approach every project with meticulous attention to detail. Though I may not have years of experience yet, I believe my dedication, problem-solving abilities, and collaborative spirit are my strongest assets.
